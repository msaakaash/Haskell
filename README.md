# Haskell Code Repository

This repository contains my Haskell code for various exercises and implementations. It includes solutions and implementations related to recursion, pattern matching, higher-order functions, and other fundamental Haskell concepts.

## Structure

The repository is organized into different sections:
- **FunctionalComposition**: Contains all the codes related to function composition.
- **HigherOrderFunctions**: Contains all the codes related to various Higher Order functions.
- **Lists**: Contains all the codes related to lists.
- **Recursion** : Contains all codes related to recursion

## Requirements

To build and run the code in this repository, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Haskell Platform](https://www.haskell.org/platform/) (GHC, Cabal, etc.)
- Optionally, an IDE or editor with Haskell support, such as [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the Haskell extension, or [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).
