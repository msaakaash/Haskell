# Haskell Code Repository
## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This repository contains my Haskell code for various exercises and implementations. It includes solutions and implementations related to recursion, pattern matching, higher-order functions, and other fundamental Haskell concepts.



## Requirements

To build and run the code in this repository, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Haskell Platform](https://www.haskell.org/platform/) (GHC, Cabal, etc.)
- Optionally, an IDE or editor with Haskell support, such as [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the Haskell extension, or [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).
